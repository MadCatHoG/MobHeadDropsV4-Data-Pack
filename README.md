# Mob Head Drops V4 Data Pack for Minecraft 1.15
Mob Head Drops V4 Data Pack allows mobs to drop their heads on player kill. Included are all mob heads added in Minecraft 1.15 and updated some of the old entities based on changes to the game (like Villagers and Zombie Villagers and Cats). This project was made from scratch since loot tables are different in Minecraft 1.15.

To enable the datapack, copy the zip file under the releases directory into your map's "datapacks" folder. If your server is running, make sure to run /reload.
